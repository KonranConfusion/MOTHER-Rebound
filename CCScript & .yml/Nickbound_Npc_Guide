so, if you want me to move any of the sprites around, so they're in different spots, just like mention it on the team psyonics chat or smthn.
there's also a chance i messed stuff up. it's probably just best to leave it be if i did.
ONETT
     we really don't need to do every npc here. it's night time in the hack, so prolly not that many npcs would be out.
     besides vauge murmurings about ness' dissapearance, and the sharks coming back, led by a mysterious robotic leader, onett is it's usual happy self. it's night time, so lean into those sorta vibes.
